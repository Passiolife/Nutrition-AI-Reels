# Nutrition-AI-Reels

Let's create some amazing Insta Reels and YouTube Shorts by leveraging real-time on-device food recognition! 

This repo gives you the code that can add an amazing reel-creator feature to your app. 
The reel-creator uses real-time on-device recognition of foods to create fabulous food log, recipe and "what I eat in a day videos". 

The repo come with a demo app that you can use out of the box. The code can be adjusted to meet your style and design needs, but the Reels-creator is working out of the box and is ready for integration into your app.

To use Passio's Nutrition-AI SDK you will need a license key. You can get one here: passio.ai/nutrition-ai The use of the SDK is free when you have under 10 active users so you can experiment and use it in demo and dev efforts for free.
